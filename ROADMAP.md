## üìù Notes

### Design Principles
1. **Intuitive First**: Every feature should be self-explanatory
2. **Visual Learning**: Prefer visual explanations over text
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Don't overwhelm beginners
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Every action should have clear response
5. **Mobile-First**: Design for all screen sizes

### Technical Debt to Address
- Component prop drilling (consider Context API)
- Type safety improvements needed
- Bundle size optimization
- Test coverage currently at 0%

### Future Considerations
- Server-side training for large models
- Collaborative learning features
- Integration with popular ML frameworks
- Course/curriculum integration
- Community model sharing
