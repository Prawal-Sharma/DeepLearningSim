## Your First Neural Network (3 minutes)

### Step 1: Build a Network
1. You're already on the **Builder** tab
2. Click **"Use Preset"** in the welcome modal
3. Select **"XOR Network"** - a classic beginner problem
4. Your network is ready!

### Step 2: Train the Model
1. Click the **Training** tab
2. The XOR dataset is already selected
3. Click **"Start Training"** (green button)
4. Watch the loss decrease and accuracy increase!
5. See the decision boundary form in real-time

### Step 3: Understand What Happened
1. Click the **Learn** tab
2. Read the "Neural Network" concept card
3. Explore the Activation Function Visualizer
4. Try the interactive tutorials

## Try Something More Advanced

### Create Your Own Dataset
1. Go to **Data** tab
2. Click **"Draw Mode ON"**
3. Select Class 0 (blue) and click to add points
4. Select Class 1 (red) and add different points
5. Click **"Use for Training"**
6. Go back to Training tab - your dataset is loaded!

### Optimize Your Model
1. In the **Training** tab, find Hyperparameter Tuner
2. Select **"Auto-Tune"** mode
3. Click **"Start Tuning"**
4. Watch as it finds the best parameters
5. Click **"Apply Best"** to use them
